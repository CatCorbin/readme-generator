## Description

This project is used through the command line interface (CLI). It aids in helping developers create a README file for any project they are working on. It is easier than taking the time to type out a whole README for every project worked on, and asks the user questions that in turn are filtered into the correct position in the README file that is automatically generated for the user.

## Usage

 A README generator is a great asset for any developer. Every project needs to have a unique README file. For programmers who work on many different projects, it can be extermely tedious to type out a whole README file for every individual project worked on. Utilizing a program that automatically generates a README for the user after answering only a few questions saves time and energy that can better spent on working on other aspects of the program.
